1. Overview
The Bookmark Manager is a web application that allows users to save, edit, and delete web bookmarks. It provides functionalities for managing bookmarks effectively with features like pagination and immediate feedback upon operations.

2. Architecture
The application is developed using Angular, a modern web framework. Key Angular features used include components for UI blocks, services for data management, and routing for navigation between pages.

3. Components
· AppComponent: Root component that houses the primary layout and routing outlet.
· OverviewComponent: Handles the main functionality of adding, displaying, editing, and deleting bookmarks. It also manages pagination.
· ResultsComponent: Displays a success message after adding a bookmark and allows navigation back to the main page.

4. Services
· BookmarkService: Central service that manages the bookmarks array. It provides methods to manipulate (add, edit, delete) and retrieve bookmarks. Data is stored in localStorage to simulate persistence.

5. Routing Defined routes:
· overview: Shows the main page with bookmarks.
· results: Shows a confirmation page after adding a bookmark.

6. Limitations
· Persistence: Uses localStorage which is only suitable for small-scale applications and is not ideal for production environments where data needs to persist on a server.
· Validation: Basic URL validation which might not cover all edge cases or malformed URLs.

7. Future Enhancements
· Enhance data storage by integrating with a backend service.
· Implement more robust URL validation.
· Improve UI and UX for a more polished look and feel.
